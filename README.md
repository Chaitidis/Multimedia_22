# Proposed Project: Audio Encoder/Decoder

The proposed project aims to implement a simplified encoder/decoder of audio according to the MPEG1 Layer III standard. The process includes the following steps:

1. Splitting the signal into frequency subbands.
2. DCT implementation.
3. Application of the psychoacoustic model.
4. Quantization (and dequantization) of DCT coefficients.
5. Run Length Encoding (and Decoding).
6. Huffman encoding (and decoding).
